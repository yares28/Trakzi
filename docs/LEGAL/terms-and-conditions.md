1. Who we are

Trakzi is operated by Yahya Fares (Spain) (“Trakzi”, “we”, “us”).

2. Acceptance

By creating an account or using the Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

3. The Service (no financial advice)

Trakzi helps you organize and analyze your personal finance data (transactions, categories, charts) and may offer AI-assisted chat features.

Trakzi is not a bank, accounting firm, or financial advisor. The Service is informational. You remain responsible for verifying accuracy and making decisions.

4. Accounts

You must provide accurate account details and keep them up to date. You are responsible for activity under your account. We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or abuse the Service.

5. Uploads and extracted data (no file storage)

You may upload files (e.g., bank statements, receipts) to extract transaction data. Trakzi does not store your uploaded files or receipt images—only the extracted data you choose to keep in your account.

You confirm you have the right to upload and process the files you submit.

6. Plans, limits, and usage

Trakzi offers Free and paid subscriptions.

Free plan: up to 400 total transactions stored.
If you reach the cap, you can still view and delete existing transactions, but you cannot add/import more until you delete transactions or upgrade.

Pro: up to 3,000 total transactions stored.
Max: Unlimited transactions (subject to reasonable use to protect platform stability).

Other features and limits (e.g., AI chat message limits, exports) are described on the pricing page and may be updated from time to time.

7. Subscription trial, billing, and cancellation
7.1 Trial

Trakzi may offer a 1-month free trial for Pro. If you do not cancel before the end of the trial, your subscription will renew and you will be charged the subscription fee.

7.2 Auto-renewal

Subscriptions renew automatically (monthly or yearly) until cancelled.

7.3 Cancellation

You can cancel at any time. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period; you keep access until then.

7.4 Refunds

Refunds are case-by-case at Trakzi’s reasonable discretion. Contact help@trakzi.com
 with details.

7.5 Right of withdrawal (EU consumers)

If you are an EU consumer buying online, you may have a 14-day right of withdrawal for distance contracts, subject to exceptions—particularly for services that begin immediately with your consent and acknowledgement.

bypass plan limits or security controls;

upload malware or attempt to disrupt the Service;

scrape, reverse engineer, or abuse the Service.

9. Intellectual property

The Service and its components are protected by IP laws. You receive a limited, revocable, non-exclusive right to use the Service according to your plan.

10. Feedback

If you provide feedback, you allow Trakzi to use it without compensation.

11. Disclaimers

The Service is provided “as is” and “as available.” We do not guarantee extracted data is error-free or that the Service will be uninterrupted.

12. Limitation of liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Trakzi will not be liable for indirect or consequential damages. Total liability is limited to amounts paid in the 12 months before the claim (or €0 for Free users), except where liability cannot be limited by law.

These Terms are governed by Spanish law. Disputes will be subject to the courts of Valencia, Spain, unless mandatory consumer protections apply.
