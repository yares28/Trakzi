D) Cookie Policy (PostHog + Session Replay)

COOKIE POLICY
Effective date: [01/01/2026]
This website uses cookies and similar technologies for essential functionality and analytics.

1. What cookies are

Cookies are small files stored on your device that help websites function and, in some cases, measure usage.

2. Types of cookies we use

Strictly necessary cookies
Used for core functionality such as authentication and security. These are required for the Service to operate.

Analytics cookies (PostHog)
Used to understand how users interact with Trakzi (e.g., pages viewed, feature usage) to improve the product.

Session replay (PostHog)
If enabled, session replay helps us understand usability issues by replaying interactions. We configure the tool to avoid collecting sensitive content where possible (e.g., masking inputs). Because this can be intrusive, it should be enabled only with appropriate consent and safeguards.

In Spain/EU, analytics cookies generally require consent unless configured and used in a strictly exempt manner.
